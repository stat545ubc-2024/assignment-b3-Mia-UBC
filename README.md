# Welcome to my Shiny App!

This app allows the user to do some basic filtering of the *penguins* dataset from the *palmerpenguins* package. Specifically, the user can filter the dataset by the penguins species, sex, and island or residence. Additionally, the *DT* package is used, which compacts the resulting table, allows the columns to be sorted in ascending or descending order, and allows the user to search the table for a specific value.
