# Welcome to my Shiny App!

This app allows the user to do some basic filtering of the *penguins* dataset from the *palmerpenguins* package. Specifically, the user can filter the dataset by the penguins species, sex, and island or residence. Additionally, the *DT* package is used, which compacts the resulting table, allows the columns to be sorted in ascending or descending order, and allows the user to search the table for a specific value.

## Description of contents

This repository contains one folder, entitled "Assignment-B3". This folder contains the file with the code for my app, "app.R", and a folder entitled "rsconnect/shinyapp.io/mia-ubc". The file can be run in R, and all the required libraries are specified at the top of the file. The folder contains the "Assignment-B3.dcf" file, which is responsible for publishing my app to the shiny.io servers.
